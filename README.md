# abm-mesa-experimentations

A collection of agent-based models built with Mesa, a Python framework for agent-based modeling.

## Models

- Foraging Ants : Simulations of ant colony foraging behavior (versions 1 & 2 depending on the version of the memory used)
- Guerrilla Warfare : Model analyzing guerrilla warfare dynamics
- Memory Module : Implementations of agent memory systems
- Virus-Antibody : Simulation of virus-antibody interactions (to come)

## Getting Started

Each model is contained in its own directory with dedicated README and execution instructions.

```bash
# Example: Running the foraging ants model
cd foraging_ants_V1
python app.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Mesa
- Other dependencies listed in individual project requirements.txt files
