| Aspect                    | Classical Engagement                      | Ambush Engagement                                |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Visibility               | Mutual visibility                         | Guerrillas are hidden; defenders are exposed     |
| Fire Effectiveness       | Symmetrical (both sides fire equally)     | Asymmetrical: guerrillas fire effectively, defenders shoot blindly |
| Mathematical Model       | Square Law (Lanchester)                   | Modified asymmetric model (Deitchman adaptation) |
| Governing Equations      | dx₁/dt = -a·x₂  <br> dx₂/dt = -b·x₁        | dx₁/dt = -A·x₂·x₁  <br> dx₂/dt = -b·x₁            |
| Required Superiority     | Global numerical and firepower advantage  | Local superiority and tactical advantage         |
| Likely Outcome           | Side with more numbers or firepower wins  | Guerrillas can win despite being outnumbered     |
